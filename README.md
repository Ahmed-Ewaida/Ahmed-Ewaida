## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hey, I’m Ahmed Ewaida

A builder at heart. I love turning ideas into real, working solutions that people actually use. I’m not just in this to write code — I’m here to **create impact**.

I care deeply about clean design, clear logic, and solving real problems in smart ways. Whether it’s a mobile app that helps someone save time, a backend system that runs quietly and efficiently, or a user experience that just feels right — I’m all in.

I move fast, learn faster, and stay curious. I believe that great work is built on **clarity, consistency, and care**.

## 💬 What Drives Me

I have acquired the fundamentals of the Dart language and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. I have a basic understanding of Flutter, including using widgets, building models, and receiving and sending data to APIs. Additionally, I have experience using GitHub for version control and teamwork, and installing Flutter packages. I have also worked as a freelancer on an e-commerce project and a calling app.

## 🔍 What I Often Work With

I build with tools like **Flutter**, **Figma**, **MySQL**, and **Postman**, but tools change. The mindset stays: **solve the problem, make it clean, make it last**.

> I build things with care, code with intention, and always aim to leave things better than I found them.
